ChangeTextBehaviorLocalTest doesn't compile

ChangeTextBehaviorKtTest fails to run with error:
androidx.test.espresso.base.AssertionErrorHandler$AssertionFailedWithCauseError: 'an instance of android.widget.TextView and view.getText() with or without transformation to match: is "Espresso"' doesn't match the selected view.
Expected: an instance of android.widget.TextView and view.getText() with or without transformation to match: is "Espresso"
Got: view.getText() was "Hello Espresso!" transformed text was "Hello Espresso!"
